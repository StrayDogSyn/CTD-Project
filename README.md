## Description
A simple quiz game that utilizes the Marvel API to generate the questions and validates answers. Another version utilizing the deprecated Star Wars API is also included, fufilling the assignment requirements of using two different APIs in the project.
Functionality is the primary concern of this project, it utilizes technologies I still am attempting to master. The quiz itself is a work in progress, as it is far from the polished version I would consider to be production level quality.
The original coding project from my TLM (The Last Mile) project is also included and can be navigated to/from the hidden nav (?) icon on each of the pages.

### Technologies Used
1. Vanilla JavaScript for programming logic
2. Marvel Developers API
3. Spotify Developers API
4. Bootstrap Framework
5. Font Awesome Free Kit for Icons
